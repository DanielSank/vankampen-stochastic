\leveldown{$Q_s$ functions in the grand-canonical ensemble - pg. 32}

\leveldown{Problem}

Write explicitly the functions $Q_s$ for the grand canonical ensemble of an ideal gas in a fixed volume.

\levelstay{Solution}

In the context of the grand canonical ensemble with only one chemical species, the functions $Q_N$ are probability distributions over the state of subsystems of the ensemble of volume $V$.
The subsystems are characterized by number of particles $N$ and total energy $U_m$.
Therefore, $Q_N(U_m)$ is the probability that a subsystem has $N$ particles and is in energy state $U_m$.
In the grand-canonical ensemble
\begin{equation}
  U_m = T S - P V + N \mu
  \, .
\end{equation}
The probability of a state is determined by its entropy, because entropy measures the number of possible configurations out of the total number of configurations available.
In this case
\begin{equation}
  Q_N(U_m) = e^{-S/k}
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the entropy consistent with the number of particles and the energy of the system, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  Q_N(U_m)
  = \exp \left(\frac{PV}{kT} - \frac{U_m}{kT} + \frac{N \mu}{kT} \right)
  \, .
\end{equation}
