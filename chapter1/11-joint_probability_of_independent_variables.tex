\leveldown{Problem}

What is the form of the joint probability if density if all variables are mutually independent?

\levelstay{Solution}

Use Bayes's rule again:
\begin{align*}
  P_{A,B,C}(a, b, c)
  &= P_A(a) P_{B,C|A}(b, c | a) \\
  &= P_A(a) P_{B,C}(b, c) \\
  &= P_A(a) P_B(b) P_{C|B}(c | b) \\
  &= P_A(a) P_B(b) P_C(c)
  \, .
\end{align*}
Therefore, when all variables are mutually exclusive, the joint probability factorizes into a product of the marginals.
