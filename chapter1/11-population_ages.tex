\leveldown{Problem}

The probability distribution of lifetimes in a population is $P(t)$.
Show that the conditional probability for individuals of age $\tau$ is
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{die at age}|\text{alive at age}}(t | \tau) = P(t) / \int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt' \quad (t > \tau) \, .
\end{equation*}
Note that in the case $P(t) = \gamma e^{-\gamma t}$ one has $P_{\text{die at age}|\text{alive at age}}(t|\tau) = P(t - \tau)$: the survival chance is independent of age.
Show that this is the only $P$ for which that is true.

\levelstay{Solution}

Use Bayes's rule,
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{die at age}|\text{alive at age}}(t | \tau)
= \frac{P_{\text{die at age \& alive at age}}(t, \tau)}{P_{\text{alive at age}}(\tau)} \, .
\end{equation*}
If your age is $\tau$ that means you die at some time $t'$ such that $t' > \tau$.
Therefore, the probability that a given person is still alive at age $\tau$ is
\begin{equation*}
\text{alive at age }\tau = \int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt' \, .
\end{equation*}
Also, when $t > \tau$, the joint probability that a person is alive at $\tau$ and dies at $t$ is the same thing as the marginal probability that the person dies at $t$.
Therefore we have
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{die at age}|\text{alive at age}}(t | \tau)
= \frac{P(t)}{\int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt'}
\end{equation*}
as we wanted to show.

Now we suppose $P(t) = \gamma e^{-\gamma t}$.
Then the integral is
\begin{align*}
\int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt'
&= \gamma \left. \frac{e^{-\gamma t}}{-\gamma} \right|_\tau^\infty \\
&= e^{-\gamma \tau} \, .
\end{align*}
Therefore, the conditional probability is
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{die at age}|\text{alive at age}}(t | \tau)
= \frac{\gamma e^{-\gamma t}}{e^{-\gamma \tau}} = \gamma e^{-\gamma (t - \tau)}
= P_\text{die at age} ( t - \tau)
\end{equation*}
which is what we wanted to show.

To show that there is only one possible $P(t)$ with the property we just demonstrated, we use calculus:
\begin{align*}
P(t - \tau) &= \frac{P(t)}{\int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt'} \\
\int_\tau^\infty P(t') \, dt' &= \frac{P(t)}{P(t - \tau)} \\
(\text{differentiate w.r.t. }\tau) \qquad -P(\tau) &= -\frac{P(t)}{P(t - \tau)^2}
\left( - P'(t-\tau) \right) \\
P'(t - \tau) &= - \frac{P(\tau)P(t - \tau)^2}{P(t)} \\
(\text{set }\tau=0) \quad P'(t) &= - P(0)P(t) \\
P(t) &= P(0) e^{-P(0) \, t} \, .
\end{align*}
Denoting $P(0)$ as $\gamma$ gives the result.
