\leveldown{Problem}

Calculate $Q_s$ for the given recipe of construction of a random set of dots
\levelstay{Solution}
We need to find a description of a sequence of random events at $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$, ..., in terms of the probability distribution $Q_s$ using the probability $w$. The $w$ probability is the simplest description of correlated random events : the new arrival is dependent on the timing from the previous arrival and both arrivals are governed by the same probability function $w$. We may as well represent this situation by having $s$ replicas of the system and reporting the first random events in each of these systems. Such first event would be governed by a probability $w$. We can write $Q_s$ as a probability of events that are independent of one another in each of these systems.
\begin{equation}
Q_s(\tau_1, \tau_2,...,\tau_s)=P(\tau_1)P(\tau_2)...P(\tau_s)
\end{equation}
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& P(\tau_1)= w(\tau_1) \\
& P(\tau_2)= \int_{0}^{\tau_2}w(\tau_2-\tau_1)d\tau_1\\
& P(\tau_3)=  \int_{0}^{\tau_3}w(\tau_3-\tau_2)d\tau_2\\
& ... \\
& P(\tau_s)=  \int_{0}^{\tau_s}w(\tau_s-\tau_{s-1})d\tau_{s-1}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Finally
\begin{equation}
Q_s(\tau_1, \tau_2,...,\tau_s)=w(\tau_1)\int_{0}^{\tau_2}w(\tau_2-\tau_1)d\tau_1...\int_{0}^{\tau_s}w(\tau_s-\tau_{s-1})d\tau_{s-1}
\end{equation}
