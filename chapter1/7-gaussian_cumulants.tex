\leveldown{Gauss distribution cumulants - pg. 7}

\leveldown{Problem}

Show that for the Gauss distribution all cumulants beyond the second are zero.
Find the most general distribution with this property.

\levelstay{Solution}

The generating function for the Gaussian is
\begin{align*}
  G(k)
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \exp \left[ - \frac{-x^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right] e^{i k x} \, dx \\
  &= \exp \left[ - \frac{\sigma^2 k^2}{2} \right] \\
    \ln G(k)
  &= - \frac{\sigma^2 k^2}{2} \, .
\end{align*}
Therefore, all of the cumulants are zero except for the second, which is $\sigma^2$.

If we add in a first cumulant, we'd wind up with a Gaussian shifted away from zero.
So, I guess the most general distribution with all cumulants beyond the second is just a shifted Gaussian.
