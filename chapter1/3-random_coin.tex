\leveldown{Problem}

Flip a coint $N$ times.
Prove that the probability that heads turn up exactly $n$ times is
\begin{equation*}
  p_n = 2^{-N} \binom{N}{n} \quad (n=0,1,2,\ldots,N)
\end{equation*}
which is the binomial distribution.
If heads gains one penny and tails loses one, find the probability distribution for the total gain.

\levelstay{Solution}

The probability that any one flip is a heads is $2^{-1}$.
Therefore, the probability of any one particular string of heads and tails is $2^{-N}$.
We have to multiply that by the number of possible strings of heads/tails which contains exactly $n$ heads.
Consider a prototypical string with $n$ heads.
There are $N!$ ways of arranging \emph{all} the flips.
However, arranging the heads amongst themselves gives the same string; there are $n!$ such rearrangements.
Similarly, there are $(N-n)!$ ways of rearranging the tails amongst themselves.
Therefore, there are
\begin{equation*}
  2^{-N} \frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!} = 2^{-N} \binom{N}{n}
\end{equation*}
ways to get $n$ heads.

For the probability distribution of the final random walk position, denote the final gain as $g$, the number of heads as $n$, and the number of tails as $m$.
We have two equations
\begin{align*}
  n + m = N \\
  n - m = g
  \, .
\end{align*}
Therefore, $n = (N + g) / 2$ and the probability distribution is
\begin{equation*}
  P(g | N) = 2^{-N} \frac{N!}{\left( \frac{N+g}{2} \right)! \left( \frac{N-g}{2}\right)!}
  \, .
\end{equation*}
