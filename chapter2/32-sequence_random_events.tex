\leveldown{Description of a sequence of random events - pg. 32}

\leveldown{Problem}

Calculate $Q_s$ for the given recipe of construction of a random set of dots.

\levelstay{Solution}

We need to find a description of a sequence of random events at $\{\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots \}$ in terms of the probability distribution $Q_s$ using the probability $w$.
The $w$ probability is the simplest description of correlated random events: the new arrival is dependent on the timing from the previous arrival and both arrivals are governed by the same probability function $w$.
We may as well represent this situation by having $s$ replicas of the system and reporting the first random events in each of these systems.
Such first event would be governed by a probability $w$.
We can write $Q_s$ as a probability of events that are independent of one another in each of these systems.
\begin{equation}
  Q_s(\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots, \tau_s) = P(\tau_1) P(\tau_2) \ldots P(\tau_s)
  \, .
\end{equation}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
  P(\tau_1) &= w(\tau_1) \\
  P(\tau_2) &= \int_{0}^{\tau_2} w(\tau_2-\tau_1) \, d\tau_1\\
  P(\tau_3) &= \int_{0}^{\tau_3} w(\tau_3-\tau_2) \, d\tau_2\\
  \ldots \\
  P(\tau_s) &= \int_0^{\tau_s} w(\tau_s-\tau_{s-1}) \, d\tau_{s-1}
  \, .
\end{align*}
Finally
\begin{equation}
  Q_s(\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots, \tau_s)
  =w(\tau_1) \int_0^{\tau_2} w(\tau_2-\tau_1) \, d\tau_1 \ldots \int_0^{\tau_s} w(\tau_s-\tau_{s-1}) \, d\tau_{s-1}
  \, .
\end{equation}
