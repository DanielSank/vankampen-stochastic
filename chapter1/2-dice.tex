\leveldown{Dice - pg. 2}

\leveldown{Problem}

Let $X$ be the number of points obtained by casting a die.
Give its range and probability distribution.
Same question for casting two dice.

\levelstay{Solution}

For one die, the range is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
The probability distribution is $1/6$ for each.
For two dice, the range is $\{2, 3, \ldots , 12\}$.
The probability distribution is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{36} \left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 \right\} \, .
\end{equation*}
